The File "hwesupp.Rmd" is an R Markdown file that contains
Appendices S1--S6, and is sufficient to reproduce all of the results
of @gerard2022comment. It has been knitted into "hwesupp.pdf"

The file "sims.csv" contains the simulation output from
Appendix S5 of "hwesupp.Rmd".

The file "table2_power.Rmd" contains one iteration of
"table2_power.R" from @wang2021tracing, annotated to
demonstrate the mistakes here. It has been knitted into
"table2_power.pdf".

Much of the code from @wang2021tracing and
@wang2022asymptotic were packaged by us in the `{hexocto}`
package on GitHub <https://github.com/dcgerard/hexocto>.

A fork of the original code from @wang2021tracing and
@wang2022asymptotic may be found at at
<https://github.com/dcgerard/hexaploid> and
<https://github.com/dcgerard/OctoploidDeer>.
