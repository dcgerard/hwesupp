# Supplementary Material for Gerard (2022)

[![NSF-2132247](https://img.shields.io/badge/NSF-2132247-blue.svg)](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2132247)

The File “hwesupp.Rmd” is an R Markdown file that contains Appendices
S1–S5, and is sufficient to reproduce all of the results of Gerard
(2022). It has been knitted into “hwesupp.pdf”

The file “sims.csv” contains the simulation output from Appendix S5 of
“hwesupp.Rmd”.

The file “table2_power.Rmd” contains one iteration of “table2_power.R”
from Wang et al. (2021), annotated to demonstrate the mistakes here. It
has been knitted into “table2_power.pdf”.

Much of the code from Wang et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2022) were
packaged by us in the `{hexocto}` package on GitHub
<https://github.com/dcgerard/hexocto>.

A fork of the original code from Wang et al. (2021) and Wang et al.
(2022) may be found at at <https://github.com/dcgerard/hexaploid> and
<https://github.com/dcgerard/OctoploidDeer>.
